If we draw a power law distribution in log-log scale, the distribution will look like a straight line.
The Preferential Attachment Model generates a network with a power law degree distribution.

in the small-world model starting with k nearest neighbors, increasing the
 rewiring probability p generally decreases both the average clustering coefficient and average shortest path.
Some Small-world networks have high local clustering coefficient and small average shortest path.
